<h2 align="center"> About the project </h2>
<p> This project is based on the previous <a href="https://github.com/ivanKispaj/swiftUiVkApp.git">VKAppSwiftUI</a> project</p>
<p> The goal of the project was to split the monolithic project into separate modules. In my opinion, the goal has been achieved, if someone thinks that this is not the case, then please write to me what should be finalized, because I am only learning!
